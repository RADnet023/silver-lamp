Deployment

This section outlines the steps to deploy the SecureAuth Platform to a live environment. We'll focus on deploying the frontend on Vercel and the backend (including the database) on Heroku.

Frontend (Vercel)

Initialize a Git repository: If you haven't already, initialize a Git repository in your project's root directory (platform-app) and commit your code.

Create a Vercel account: Sign up for a Vercel account if you don't have one.

Import your project: Import your project from your Git repository into Vercel.

Configure environment variables:  In your Vercel project settings, add the necessary environment variables, such as:

NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: The URL of your backend API (e.g., https://your-backend-app.herokuapp.com).
Deploy: Deploy your frontend application on Vercel. Vercel will automatically build and deploy your React application.

Backend (Heroku)

Create a Heroku account: Sign up for a Heroku account if you don't have one.

Create a new Heroku app: Create a new Heroku application and select Node.js as the runtime.

Connect your Git repository: Connect your project's Git repository to your Heroku app.

Configure environment variables: In your Heroku app settings, add the necessary environment variables, such as:

DB_HOST, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD, DB_DATABASE: Your MySQL database credentials.
JWT_SECRET_KEY: Your secret key for JWT signing.
Provision a database:

Option 1: Heroku Postgres: You can provision a Heroku Postgres database directly from the Heroku dashboard. This is a convenient option, but you'll need to migrate your database schema to Postgres.
Option 2: External MySQL: If you prefer to use your existing MySQL database, you'll need to allow connections from your Heroku app's IP address(es). You can find the IP address(es) of your Heroku app in the Heroku dashboard.
Deploy: Deploy your backend application to Heroku. Heroku will automatically build and deploy your Node.js application.

Database Deployment

Heroku Postgres: If you're using Heroku Postgres, the database will be provisioned automatically when you create your Heroku app.
External MySQL: If you're using an external MySQL database, ensure it's accessible from your Heroku app's IP address(es). Configure the database connection details in your backend code or environment variables.
Database migrations: If you have database migrations (scripts to update the database schema), run them on the deployed database to ensure it's up-to-date.
Additional Considerations

Domain name: Configure your domain name to point to your deployed frontend application on Vercel.
SSL certificate: Obtain and install an SSL certificate to enable HTTPS for your website.
Security: Review and implement security best practices for your chosen deployment platform (Heroku).
Monitoring: Set up monitoring tools to track the performance and health of your deployed application.
Scaling: Consider scalability aspects for both your frontend and backend as your user base grows
