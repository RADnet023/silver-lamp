Use code with caution.

Explanation

Import socket.io-client: Import the socket.io-client library in your frontend component.
Establish connection: Create a new socket connection using io('your_backend_url', { ... }).
Replace your_backend_url with the actual URL of your backend Socket.io server.
Include the auth option to send the user's JWT for authentication.
connect event: Listen for the connect event to confirm that the connection is established.
Emit a joinRoom event to join the relevant chat room (e.g., using the conversation ID).
Event listeners: Set up event listeners for events emitted by the server, such as:
newMessage: To receive new messages in real-time.
(Other events as needed for your chat functionality)
Emitting events: Use socket.emit(...) to send events to the server (e.g., sendMessage to send a new message).
Disconnecting: Handle disconnections gracefully using the disconnect event or by manually calling socket.disconnect() when the component unmounts.
Key points

Connection establishment: Establishes a connection to the Socket.io server on the backend.
Authentication: Sends the user's JWT for authentication when connecting.
Event handling: Listens for events emitted by the server and emits events to send data to the server.
Real-time updates: Enables real-time updates in the chat interface by receiving new messages and other events from the server.
