# Install dependencies for both frontend and backend
npm install --workspace frontend
npm install --workspace backend
Use code with caution.

Database setup:
<!-- end list -->

Install MySQL: If you don't have MySQL installed locally, download and install it from the official website (https://www.mysql.com/).
Create databases: Create the two databases (if0_37203451_db_users and platform_data) using a MySQL client or a tool like phpMyAdmin.
Execute SQL script: Execute the SQL script provided earlier to create the necessary tables in each database.
Configure database connection: Ensure that the database credentials in your .env.local file match your local database setup.
<!-- end list -->

Start the development server:
<!-- end list -->

Navigate to the frontend directory: cd frontend
Start the frontend development server:
<!-- end list -->

Bash
npm run dev
Use code with caution.

Open a new terminal window and navigate to the backend directory: cd backend
Start the backend development server:
<!-- end list -->

Bash
node server.js
Use code with caution.

This will start both the frontend and backend development servers, and you should be able to access your application in your browser at the specified URL (usually http://localhost:3000 for the frontend).

Additional notes

Remember to replace the placeholder values in the code snippets (e.g., database credentials, API URLs) with your actual values.
Customize the code and styling to match your specific requirements.
Implement authentication middleware and authorization logic to protect your API routes and dashboard pages.
Set up a proper session store (e.g., using Redis or a database) for production use.
Ensure that passwords are hashed securely before storing them in the database.
Add error handling and input validation to your API routes and frontend components.
Deploy your application on Vercel (frontend) and a suitable platform like Heroku or AWS (backend) for production.
