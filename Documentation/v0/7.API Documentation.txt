IV. API Documentation

This section provides detailed documentation for the SecureAuth Platform API, focusing on authentication endpoints.

Authentication

The authentication API handles user login and registration, providing secure access to the platform.

/api/auth/login (POST)

Description: Authenticates a user with their username and password.
Request Body:
JSON
{
  "username": "user123",
  "password": "secure_password"
}
Use code with caution.

Response (Success - 200 OK):
JSON
{
  "message": "Login successful",
  "authKey": "your_auth_key", // Include the authKey for platform redirect
  "token": "your_jwt_token"  // Include the JWT in the response
}
Use code with caution.

Response (Error - 401 Unauthorized):
JSON
{
  "message": "Invalid credentials" 
}
Use code with caution.

Error Handling:
Returns a 401 Unauthorized status code if the credentials are invalid.
Returns a 500 Internal Server Error status code if there's a server-side error (e.g., database connection error).
/api/auth/register (POST)

Description: Registers a new user account.
Request Body:
JSON
{
  "username": "newuser",
  "password": "new_password",
  "email": "newuser@example.com" // Optional
}
Use code with caution.

Response (Success - 201 Created):
JSON
{
  "message": "User registered successfully"
}
Use code with caution.

Response (Error - 400 Bad Request):
JSON
{
  "message": "Username already exists" // Or other validation errors
}
Use code with caution.

Error Handling:
Returns a 400 Bad Request status code if there are validation errors (e.g., missing required fields, invalid email format, weak password).
Returns a 500 Internal Server Error status code if there's a server-side error.
Additional Notes

Security:
The API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure authentication.
Passwords are hashed using a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) before being stored in the database.
The API should implement measures to protect against common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
Headers:
The API expects a Content-Type: application/json header for requests with JSON bodies.
Authentication Middleware:
Protected routes (e.g., /api/users/profile, /api/chat/conversations) require a valid JWT in the Authorization header (Bearer <token>) for access.
Rate Limiting:
Consider implementing rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks and abuse.


Chat

The chat API enables real-time communication between users on the SecureAuth Platform.

/api/chat/conversations (GET)

Description: Retrieves a list of conversations for the authenticated user.
Headers:
Authorization: Bearer <JWT> (Include the user's JWT for authentication)
Response (Success - 200 OK):
JSON
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "participants": [
      { "id": 123, "username": "user123" },
      { "id": 456, "username": "user456" }
    ],
    "lastMessage": {
      "senderId": 123,
      "content": "Hello!",
      "timestamp": "2024-10-19T12:00:00Z"
    }
  },
  // ... more conversations ...
]
Use code with caution.

Error Handling:
Returns a 401 Unauthorized status code if the user is not authenticated or the JWT is invalid.
Returns a 500 Internal Server Error status code if there's a server-side error.
/api/chat/messages (GET)

Description: Retrieves messages for a specific conversation.
Headers:
Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
Query Parameters:
conversationId: ID of the conversation to retrieve messages from.
Response (Success - 200 OK):
JSON
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "conversationId": 12,
    "senderId": 123,
    "content": "Hello!",
    "timestamp": "2024-10-19T12:00:00Z"
  },
  // ... more messages ...
]
Use code with caution.

Error Handling:
Returns a 401 Unauthorized status code if the user is not authenticated or the JWT is invalid.
Returns a 403 Forbidden status code if the user is not authorized to access the conversation.
Returns a 500 Internal Server Error status code if there's a server-side error.
/api/chat/messages (POST)

Description: Sends a new message to a conversation.
Headers:
Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
Request Body:
JSON
{
  "conversationId": 12,
  "content": "This is a new message"
}
Use code with caution.

Response (Success - 201 Created):
JSON
{
  "message": "Message sent successfully"
}
Use code with caution.

Error Handling:
Returns a 400 Bad Request status code if the request body is invalid or missing required fields.
Returns a 401 Unauthorized status code if the user is not authenticated or the JWT is invalid.
Returns a 403 Forbidden status code if the user is not authorized to send a message in the conversation.
Returns a 500 Internal Server Error status code if there's a server-side error.
Additional Notes

Real-time Updates: The chat API should integrate with Socket.io to provide real-time updates for new messages and other chat events.
Pagination: For conversations with a large number of messages, consider implementing pagination to improve performance.
Filtering and Sorting: You might want to add options for filtering and sorting messages (e.g., by timestamp, sender).
Security: Implement security measures to prevent unauthorized access to conversations and messages.
Error Handling: Provide detailed error messages to help clients understand and resolve issues.
