II. Architecture

This section provides a detailed overview of the SecureAuth Platform's architecture, encompassing both the frontend and backend components and their interactions.

A. Frontend (React)

The frontend of the SecureAuth Platform is built using React, a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. It follows a component-based architecture, where the UI is divided into reusable and independent components. This promotes modularity, maintainability, and code reusability. Â  

Key Frontend Components

pages/index.js (Landing Page)

This component serves as the initial landing page for the application.
It redirects users to the login page (/login).
pages/login.js (Login Page)

This component handles user authentication.
It displays a login form with fields for username and password.
It validates user input on the client-side.
It sends an API request to the backend (/api/auth/login) to authenticate the user.
Upon successful authentication, it redirects the user to the client dashboard (/dashboard).
If authentication fails, it displays an error message to the user.
pages/dashboard.js (Client Dashboard)

This component displays the client's dashboard after successful login.
It fetches user data from the backend API (/api/users/profile).
It displays the user's profile information, recent activity, and other relevant data.
It provides navigation to other sections of the application (e.g., chat, feed, wallet).
pages/admin_dashboard.js (Admin Dashboard)

This component displays the admin dashboard, accessible only to authorized administrators.
It fetches data from the backend API relevant to admin functionalities (e.g., user management, system monitoring).
It provides tools for user management, data visualization, and system configuration.
B. Backend (Node.js with Express.js)

The backend of the SecureAuth Platform is built using Node.js with Express.js, a popular web framework for Node.js. It provides a RESTful API that handles user authentication, data storage, and other server-side logic.

Key Backend Components

API Routes

The backend defines various API routes to handle different functionalities, such as:
/api/auth/login: Authenticates user credentials and issues a JWT.
/api/auth/register: Registers new user accounts.
/api/users/profile: Retrieves user profile information.
/api/chat/conversations: Retrieves user's conversations.
/api/chat/messages: Handles sending and receiving messages.
/api/wallet/transactions: Retrieves transaction history.
/api/wallet/balances: Fetches account balances.
And other API routes as needed for the platform's features.
Controllers

Controllers handle the logic for each API route.
They receive requests, interact with the database, perform any necessary operations, and send responses.
Database Models

Models represent the structure of the database tables and provide an interface for interacting with the data.
Authentication Middleware

Middleware functions are used to verify JWTs and protect API routes that require authentication.
Authorization

Authorization logic is implemented to control access to specific features or data based on user roles and permissions.
Socket.io Integration

Socket.io is integrated to enable real-time communication features like chat and notifications.
C. Database (MySQL)

The SecureAuth Platform uses MySQL as its database management system. The database schema is designed to be modular and scalable, with separate databases for user authentication (if0_37203451_db_users) and platform-specific data (platform_data).

Key Database Tables

clients: Stores user account information.
client_details: Stores additional user details.
login_logs: Tracks user login attempts.
authorized_ips: Stores authorized IP addresses and keys.
conversations: Stores chat conversations.
messages: Stores chat messages.
posts: Stores posts for the feed.
stories: Stores stories for the feed.
crypto_wallets: Stores cryptocurrency wallet information.
bank_accounts: Stores bank account information.
...: Other tables as needed for the platform's features.
D. Interaction between Frontend and Backend

The frontend and backend components interact through API calls. The frontend sends requests to the backend API endpoints, and the backend processes those requests, interacts with the database, and sends responses back to the frontend.

Key Interactions

User authentication: The frontend sends login credentials to the /api/auth/login endpoint, and the backend verifies the credentials and returns a JWT.
Data fetching: The frontend fetches user data, notifications, chat messages, and other data from the backend API endpoints.
Data updates: The frontend sends data updates (e.g., profile changes, new messages) to the backend API endpoints.
Real-time communication: The frontend and backend communicate in real-time using Socket.io for features like chat and notifications.
