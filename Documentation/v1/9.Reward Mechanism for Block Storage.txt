Reward Mechanism for Block Storage and Verification in SecureAuth

To incentivize users to participate in the distributed ledger system and contribute to the security and stability of the SecureAuth platform, a reward mechanism is implemented for storing and verifying blocks.

1. Roles and Responsibilities

Storage Providers: Users who dedicate storage space on their devices to store copies of transaction blocks.
Validators: Users who verify the integrity of stored blocks by comparing them with other copies or performing cryptographic checks.
2. Reward Distribution

Storage Rewards: Users receive Rad tokens for storing blocks. The reward amount is calculated based on:

Storage Duration: The longer a user stores a block, the more rewards they accumulate.
Storage Space: Users with more storage capacity who store more blocks receive proportionally larger rewards.
Block Importance: Newer blocks or blocks with higher transaction volumes might be assigned higher rewards to incentivize their storage.
Verification Rewards: Users receive additional Rad tokens for verifying the integrity of stored blocks. The reward amount is determined by:

Verification Frequency: Users who verify blocks more frequently receive more rewards.
Verification Accuracy: Users who consistently provide accurate verification results earn higher rewards.
Network Contribution: Users who contribute to the verification of a larger number of blocks receive greater rewards.
3. Reward Calculation Formula

The specific reward calculation formula can be adjusted based on platform needs and economic considerations. Here's a possible example:

Storage Reward = (Storage Duration * Storage Space * Block Importance Factor) * Storage Reward Rate

Verification Reward = (Verification Frequency * Verification Accuracy * Network Contribution Factor) * Verification Reward Rate
Storage Duration: Measured in hours, days, or other time units.
Storage Space: Measured in GB or TB.
Block Importance Factor: A multiplier based on the block's importance (e.g., newer blocks have a higher factor).
Storage Reward Rate: A predefined rate (e.g., 0.001 RAD per GB per day).
Verification Frequency: Number of verifications performed per day or other time unit.
Verification Accuracy: Percentage of correct verification results.
Network Contribution Factor: A multiplier based on the number of blocks verified.
Verification Reward Rate: A predefined rate (e.g., 0.0005 RAD per verification).
4. Distribution Process

Automated Rewards: Rewards are calculated and distributed automatically at regular intervals (e.g., daily or weekly).
Reward Claims: Users might need to actively claim their rewards through the platform's interface.
Transaction Records: All reward transactions are recorded in the rad_transactions table with the type "reward" and appropriate details.
Transparency: Users can view their reward history and the calculation breakdown in their account dashboard.
5.  Additional Considerations

Reward Pool: A portion of the platform's Rad token supply can be allocated to a reward pool specifically for storage and verification rewards.
Dynamic Adjustment: The reward rates and calculation formula can be adjusted dynamically by the platform administrators based on network usage, storage demand, and economic conditions.
Anti-Abuse Measures: Implement measures to prevent abuse of the reward system (e.g., Sybil attacks, fake verification results).
