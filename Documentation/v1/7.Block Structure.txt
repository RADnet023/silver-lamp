Block Structure for SecureAuth Platform

1. Block Header

The block header contains metadata about the block, including:

*   `version`: (INT) - Version number of the block format (e.g., 1). This allows for future updates to the block structure.
*   `timestamp`: (TIMESTAMP) - The timestamp of when the block was created.
*   `previousBlockHash`: (STRING) - The hash of the previous block in the chain. This links the blocks together, forming a chain.
*   `merkleRoot`: (STRING) - The Merkle root hash of all the transactions in the block. This ensures the integrity of the transactions.
*   `nonce`: (INT) - A number used in the mining process (if applicable) to find a valid block hash.
*   `difficulty`: (INT) - The difficulty target for the block hash (if using a proof-of-work system).

2. Transaction Data Format

Each transaction within the block will have the following format:

*   `transactionId`: (INT) - A unique identifier for the transaction.
*   `userId`: (INT) - The ID of the user who initiated the transaction.
*   `type`: (ENUM) - The type of transaction (e.g., 'reward', 'purchase', 'transfer', 'conversion', 'staking', 'unstaking', 'fee').
*   `amount`: (DECIMAL) - The amount of RAD or WRAD tokens involved in the transaction.
*   `currency`: (ENUM) - The currency of the transaction ('RAD' or 'WRAD').
*   `timestamp`: (TIMESTAMP) - The timestamp of the transaction.
*   `details`: (STRING) - Optional details about the transaction (e.g., "App purchase", "Staking reward").

3. Block Size Limits

*   `maxTransactions`: (INT) - The maximum number of transactions that can be included in a single block (e.g., 1000).
*   `maxSizeBytes`: (INT) - The maximum size of the block in bytes (e.g., 1 MB).

Example Block Structure (JSON representation)

```json
{
  "header": {
    "version": 1,
    "timestamp": "2024-10-28T10:00:00Z",
    "previousBlockHash": "previous_block_hash_here",
    "merkleRoot": "merkle_root_hash_here",
    "nonce": 12345,
    "difficulty": 100
  },
  "transactions": [
    {
      "transactionId": 1,
      "userId": 101,
      "type": "reward",
      "amount": 10,
      "currency": "RAD",

      "details": "Daily reward"
    },
    {
      "transactionId": 2,
      "userId": 102,
      "type": "purchase",
      "amount": 50,
      "currency": "WRAD",
      "timestamp": "2024-10-28T09:58:00Z",
      "details": "App purchase"
    },
    // ... more transactions
  ]
}
Key Considerations

Block size limits: Choose appropriate block size limits based on factors like transaction frequency, network capacity, and storage limitations.
Data serialization: Decide how to serialize the block data for storage (e.g., JSON, binary format).
Block validation: Implement validation rules to ensure that blocks adhere to the defined structure and size limits.
Data compression: Consider using data compression techniques to reduce the size of blocks and improve storage efficiency.
Future updates: The version field in the header allows you to update the block structure in the future without breaking compatibility with older blocks.
