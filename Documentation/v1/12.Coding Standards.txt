Coding Standards

The following coding standards ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability across the SecureAuth platform's codebase:

General

Indentation: Use 4 spaces for indentation.
Line Length: Keep lines under 120 characters.
Naming Conventions:
Variables and functions: Use camelCase.
Classes: Use PascalCase.
Constants: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.
Comments: Write clear and concise comments to explain code logic, especially for complex or non-obvious parts.
Spacing: Use consistent spacing around operators and after commas.
JavaScript (Frontend and Backend)

Semicolons: Use semicolons at the end of statements.
Variable Declarations: Use const for variables that won't be reassigned, let for variables that will be reassigned.
Function Declarations: Use function expressions or arrow functions consistently.
Object and Array Literals: Use trailing commas for multi-line object and array literals.
Template Literals: Use template literals for string concatenation and interpolation.
React

Component Naming: Use PascalCase for component names.
Props: Use destructuring for props.
State: Use useState or a state management library (Redux, Zustand) for managing component state.
JSX: Use self-closing tags for components without children.
Code Style: Consider using a linter like ESLint with a React plugin (e.g., eslint-plugin-react) to enforce consistent code style.
Node.js and Express.js

Error Handling: Use async/await and try...catch blocks for error handling.
Middleware: Use middleware for common tasks like authentication, authorization, and logging.
Routing: Organize routes into separate modules.
Code Style: Consider using a linter like ESLint with a Node.js plugin (e.g., eslint-plugin-node) to enforce consistent code style.
Code Review Process

Submit a Pull Request (PR): When you have made changes to the codebase, create a pull request on the project's version control platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
Code Review: At least one other developer will review your code. The reviewer will:
Ensure the code follows the coding standards.
Check for logic errors, potential bugs, and security vulnerabilities.
Verify that the code is well-documented and understandable.
Provide feedback and suggestions for improvement.
Address Feedback: Address the feedback from the reviewer by making necessary changes to your code.
Approval and Merge: Once the reviewer approves your changes, they will merge your code into the main branch.
Branching Strategy

Main Branch: The main branch (or master) should always contain production-ready code.
Develop Branch: Create a develop branch from main for ongoing development.
Feature Branches: Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix from the develop branch.
Release Branches: Create a release branch from develop when preparing for a new release.
Hotfix Branches: Create a hotfix branch from main to address critical issues in production.
Issue Tracking

Issue Tracker: Use an issue tracking system (e.g., GitHub Issues, Jira, Trello) to:
Report bugs.
Request new features.
Suggest improvements.
Track the progress of issues.
Provide detailed information: When reporting an issue, include:
Steps to reproduce the bug.
Expected behavior.
Actual behavior.
Screenshots or error messages (if applicable).
Relevant code snippets (if applicable).
