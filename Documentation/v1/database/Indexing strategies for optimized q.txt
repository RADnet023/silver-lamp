**Types of Indexes**

*   **PRIMARY KEY:** Automatically creates a unique index on the primary key column(s).
*   **UNIQUE index:** Ensures that all values in the indexed column are unique.
*   **Non-unique index:**  Allows duplicate values in the indexed column, Â  
 but speeds up lookups based on that column.
*   **Composite index:**  Creates an index on multiple columns, useful for queries that filter or sort by multiple columns.

**Choosing the right indexes**

*   **Analyze your queries:**  Identify the columns that are frequently used in `WHERE` clauses, `JOIN` conditions, `ORDER BY` clauses, and other operations that require searching or sorting data.
*   **Consider data cardinality:**  Index columns with high cardinality (many unique values) for better performance.
*   **Avoid over-indexing:**  Too many indexes can slow down write operations (inserts, updates, deletes).

By carefully selecting and creating indexes, you can significantly improve the performance of your SecureAuth platform's database, especially as the amount of data grows.
