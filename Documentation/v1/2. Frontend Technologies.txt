1. Frontend Technologies

React:

Core library for building user interfaces.
Component-based architecture for modularity and code reuse.
JSX syntax for declarative UI definition.
Virtual DOM for efficient rendering and updates.
State Management Libraries:

Redux: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
Centralized store for managing application state.
Actions, reducers, and middleware for predictable state updates.
Good for complex applications with a lot of shared state.
Zustand: A small, fast, and scalable state management solution.
Minimalistic API and easy to learn.
Good for simple to medium-complexity applications.
Context API (built-in React): For simpler state management needs.
Provides a way to share data between components without prop drilling.
Suitable for smaller applications or localized state.
UI Framework (Optional):

Material UI: A popular React UI framework that implements Google's Material Design.
Provides a wide range of pre-built components (buttons, menus, dialogs, etc.).
Customizable and themeable.
Ant Design: Another popular React UI framework with a clean and modern design.
Offers a comprehensive set of components and design resources.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
Provides a vast collection of CSS classes for styling elements.
Highly customizable and flexible.
2. Backend Technologies

Node.js:

JavaScript runtime environment for building server-side applications.
Event-driven, non-blocking I/O model for efficient handling of concurrent requests.
Large ecosystem of modules and libraries.
Express.js:

Minimalistic and flexible web framework for Node.js.
Provides routing, middleware, and other utilities for building APIs.
Easy to learn and use.
Middleware:

Functions that execute during the request-response cycle.
Used for:
Authentication (e.g., verifying JWTs).
Authorization (e.g., checking user roles and permissions).
Logging requests and responses.
Handling errors.
Parsing request bodies (JSON, urlencoded).
Authentication:

JWT (JSON Web Token):
Industry-standard for authentication.
Securely transmits user information as a JSON object.
Signed with a secret key to prevent tampering.
Typically stored in an HTTP-only cookie for security.
Passport.js:
Popular authentication middleware for Node.js.
Supports various authentication strategies (local, OAuth, etc.).
Simplifies integration with third-party authentication providers.
3. Database Technologies

Chosen Database Systems:

MySQL: A popular open-source relational database.
Suitable for structured data and complex relationships.
Good for transactional operations.
PostgreSQL: Another powerful open-source relational database.
Offers advanced features like JSON support and extensions.
Suitable for complex data models and high-volume applications.
MongoDB: A popular NoSQL document database.
Stores data in flexible JSON-like documents.
Good for applications with evolving data structures.
Cassandra: A highly scalable NoSQL database designed for distributed data.
Excellent for handling large volumes of data and high write loads.
Suitable for applications requiring high availability and fault tolerance.
Sharding Strategy:

Horizontal partitioning: Distribute data across multiple database instances (shards) based on a shard key (e.g., user ID, transaction ID range).
Shard key selection: Choose a shard key that evenly distributes data and minimizes cross-shard queries.
Consistent hashing: Use consistent hashing to assign data to shards and minimize data movement when adding or removing shards.
Data Replication:

Master-slave replication: Replicate data from a master node to one or more slave nodes for read scalability and failover.
Multi-master replication: Allow writes to multiple master nodes for higher availability and write scalability.
4. Blockchain-like System

Block Creation:

Group transactions into blocks at regular intervals (e.g., every hour).
Include a timestamp, block number, and previous block hash in the block header.
Calculate the Merkle root of the transactions in the block.
Hashing Algorithm:

SHA-256: A widely used cryptographic hash function.
Generates a unique 256-bit hash for each block.
Ensures data integrity and tamper-proof storage.
Data Storage:

Database: Initially, store blocks in a centralized database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
Distributed Ledger (Future): Transition to a distributed ledger where users can store and verify blocks.
5. Real-time Monitoring System

Models Used:

Machine Learning Models: Train models (e.g., anomaly detection, classification) to identify suspicious transaction patterns.
Rule-based Systems: Define rules and thresholds to detect specific activities (e.g., large transactions, rapid accumulation).
Hybrid Approach: Combine machine learning and rule-based systems for comprehensive monitoring.
Data Sources:

Blockchain Data: Transaction history, block data, user balances.
Platform Data: User activity, app usage, staking data.
External Data: Market data from cryptocurrency exchanges.
Alert Mechanisms:

Real-time Alerts: Trigger alerts when suspicious activity is detected.
Notification Channels: Send alerts via in-app notifications, emails, or webhooks.
Alert Escalation: Escalate critical alerts to the admin or designated personnel.
